Requires Python 3.12 [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Required modules: tabulate, Pillow, and Rich:

```
Usage is simple, edit Config.py as needed, add more images if needed.

## One Heterogeneous and Homologous Recessive:

## Large Heterogeneous:

## Extra heckin Large Heterogeneous:
The tabulate output is too big for the terminal.
The stripes are meant to be white, but appear more dark gray becuase of premultiplied alpha, or at least I think so.
